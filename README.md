This library will interface with the GSatMicro core to send messages and commands, and decode positions. Encryption and decryption support is also available.

The supported formats for decoding are format 1 and format 2. Format 0 is a special, highly compressed format that utilizes a special GSE library to decode but conserves airtime. Please contact us for more information.

Enjoy your new GSatMicro!
